# SV-Marketing: Build beautiful marketing sites with SvelteKit

This is a component library for building basic marketing sites with SvelteKit. It's born out of the frustrating of not having any fast highly customizable component libraries for typical staticly generated marketing sites.

This still a WIP and I'm working on adding more components and improving the existing ones.

## Getting Started

To get started, install the `NPM` package:

```npm install sv-marketing```

## Components

- [ ] Hero
- [ ] Features
- [ ] Pricing
- [ ] CTA
- [ ] Footer
- [ ] Testimonials
- [ ] FAQ
- [ ] Navbar

## Design Approach

Components are designed to be highly customizable and easy to use.

A set of CSS variables are used to control the look and feel of the components. This allows you to easily change the color, font, and spacing of the components by adding your own CSS file to `+layout.svelte` file.

Components are also designed to be responsive and work well on all screen sizes.
